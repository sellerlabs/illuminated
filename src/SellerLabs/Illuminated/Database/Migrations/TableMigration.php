/**
 * Class TableMigration.
 *
 * A base migration for migrations that simply create/drop a table. Applications
 * usually have one or more of this kind. This base class simply reduces the
 * amount of repeated code and allows the table name to be defined in
 * declarative way.
 *
 * If you need to modify columns or perform other operations, please consider
 * using a different base migration class.
 *
 * To use this migration class:
 * - Extend it.
 * - Set the name of the table by overriding the `$name` property.
 * - Implement the `create(Blueprint $table)` method.
