# 0.4.0-dev

First release we track changes

**FEATURES**:
- Documentation is now automagically generated via Travis CI.

**IMPROVEMENTS**:
- `ApiResponse` now has a `fromResponse` for testing methods that return a
 `Response` generated by an `ApiResponse`. Additionally, some new getters were
 added to make it easier to get information about the response.
- The task system now supports `Spec` classes for describing and validating
 tasks automatically. A class extending `BaseTask` can now provide a single
 Spec and reference instead of a bunch of arrays describing types and defaults.
 Likewise, the task runner will check that the Spec passes before even running
 the Job.

**BUGS**:
None
